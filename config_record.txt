1. Without adaptive Images Processing


2. After Adaptive Images Processing

=== First Experiment Configuration ===
Date: 2025-09-06 20:24:28
Method: Original OCR Processing (No Adaptive Parameters)

OCR Parameters:
- width_ths: 0.7 (default)
- height_ths: 0.7 (default)
- paragraph: False
- batch_size: 1

Image Preprocessing:
- Gaussian Blur: (5, 5)
- Adaptive Threshold: ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C
- Block Size: 11
- C Value: 2

Results:
- Total Images: 19
- Total Texts: 1265
- Average Confidence: 0.371
- Excellent Rate: 10.3%
- Good Rate: 9.6%
- Fair Rate: 13.4%
- Poor Rate: 66.8%
- Overall Quality: Poor

Issues Found:
- Very low average confidence
- High percentage of poor recognition
- High variance in recognition quality



=== Third Experiment Configuration (Improved Adaptive) ===
Date: 2025-09-06 20:59:36
Method: Improved Adaptive OCR Processing

Image Quality Analysis Thresholds:
- Dark image: brightness < 100 (was 80)
- Bright image: brightness > 160 (was 180)
- Low contrast: contrast < 60 (was 50)
- Noisy image: laplacian_var < 100

Adaptive OCR Parameters:
- Low contrast: width_ths=0.3, height_ths=0.3 (very lenient)
- Noisy image: width_ths=0.6, height_ths=0.6 (strict)
- Dark image: width_ths=0.4, height_ths=0.4 (very lenient)
- Bright image: width_ths=0.5, height_ths=0.5 (lenient)
- Default: width_ths=0.7, height_ths=0.7

Enhanced Preprocessing:
- CLAHE: clipLimit=4.0 (was 3.0), tileGridSize=(8,8)
- Gamma correction: gamma=0.7 for low contrast
- Bilateral filter for noise reduction
- Adaptive brightness adjustment

Results:
- Total Images: 19
- Total Texts: 1037
- Average Confidence: 0.418 (improved from 0.371)
- Excellent Rate: 12.5% (improved from 10.3%)
- Good Rate: 9.8% (slightly improved from 9.6%)
- Fair Rate: 14.9% (improved from 13.4%)
- Poor Rate: 62.7% (improved from 66.8%)
- Overall Quality: Fair (improved from Poor)

Issues Found:
- Still very low average confidence
- High percentage of poor recognition
- High variance in recognition quality

Key Problems Identified:
- Images are too bright (brightness ~180, normal ~120-140)
- Low contrast (contrast ~49, below 60 threshold)
- Receipt printing quality issues (thermal printing artifacts)
- EasyOCR limitations with receipt-specific text
